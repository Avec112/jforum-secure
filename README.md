jforum-secure
=============

Little less public jforum. Starts with modified Jforum v2.1.8. Will try to upgrade to 2.3.5 

In 2008/2009 i started to look for a forum I could use for my purposes. Non had exactly what I wanted and very few was created in java. I found Jforum (http://jforum.net) created by Rafael Steil and others.

I downloaded the source and did some modifications regarding how to register users, what users could see, and more. Basically I wanted a more private site where users only could get invited. The forum was never supposed to run on servers other then my own and it still don't.

Anyway years have gone by and I would like to upgrade the forum. The guys at Jforum.net has stopped the development of Jforum 2 four years ago and two years ago they even stopped the Jforum 3 development. 

Then I found the site https://code.google.com/p/jforum2/ where a guy named Andowson has created a branch from the Jforum 2.1.8 and keeps maintaining it. As of now current version is 2.3.5

I want o upgrade my modified Jforum version to 2.3.5 if possible without breaking the modifications I made.

As of now I do not recommend any users to try my version of Jforum as it is not intentionally meant for distribution and might as well not serve your needs.
