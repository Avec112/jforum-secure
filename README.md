jforum-secure
=============

Little less public Jforum. Starts with modified Jforum v2.1.8. Will try to upgrade to 2.3.5.

In 2009 i started to look for a forum I could use for my purposes. Non had what I wanted and very few was created in java. I found Jforum (http://jforum.net) created by Rafael Steil and others.

I did some modifications regarding how to register users, what users could see, and more. Basically I wanted a site where users only could get invited and the forum was never supposed to run on servers other then my own.

Anyway years have gone by and I would like to upgrade the forum. The guys at Jforum.net has stopped the development two years ago. Then I found the site https://code.google.com/p/jforum2/ where a guy named Andowson has created a branch from the Jforum 2.1.8 and keeps maintaining it. As of now current version is 2.3.5

I want o upgrade my modified Jforum version to 2.3.5 if possible without breaking the stuff I did and need to have the site running. 

As of now I do not recommend any users to try my version of Jforum as it is not intentionally meant for distribution and might as well not serve your needs.
